# Work Log

The shared, dated **journal**: what was tried, what worked, measurements and gotchas. **Add to
it after every session.** It is not a status page: what's open, blocked or due lives only on
GitHub ([milestones](../../milestones), [Issues](../../issues)). Issue comments hold per-issue
detail. Decisions live in [`decisions/`](decisions/README.md).

Format: newest first. One entry per session: date, who, what, result, next.

## Session entries

## Testing and measurements

| Test | Result | Date | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| beat1 (caregiver memo) | Works, no key | 10-01 | |
| beat3 (fast-path disclosure) | Works, no key | 10-01 | 0.11s to first reply |
| beat2 (full LLM turn) | 4.22s to first audio | 10-02 | Before reasoning-off (PR #25) |
| beat2 with `enable_thinking: false` | ~0.91s to first audio | 10-03 | PR #29 |
| Day-2 recall | Cross-process persistence | 10-01 | |
| Real voice round trip | Works | 10-01 | audio -> ASR -> model -> TTS -> play |
| Hosted isolation (dry run) | Sessions independent | 10-02 | `--dry-run --keep-stage` |

## Known gotchas

- **Killing servers:** don't `kill %1` or pattern-kill inside a compound shell command (it kills your own shell). Use `fuser -k PORT/tcp`.
- **Playwright + Gradio audio upload:** click `button[aria-label='Upload file']`, then `set_input_files` on `[data-testid=file-upload]`.
- **Pull before you trust status:** your teammate may have pushed to `main`. `git pull` before trusting what you remember of the app.
- **Free HF Spaces sleep:** keep the Space awake before judging; a cold first click can hang.

## Decisions logged

One line each; the reasoning is in the ADR.

| Decision | Choice | Date | ADR |
|----------|--------|------|-----|
| TTS | pyttsx3; `espeak-ng` CLI on Linux/macOS | 10-01 (amended 10-03) | [001](decisions/ADR-001-tts-backend.md) |
| THINK + AUDIT model | Nemotron Nano 30B on Nebius | 10-01 | [002](decisions/ADR-002-think-audit-model.md) |
| Hosting | HF Spaces | 10-01 | [003](decisions/ADR-003-hosting.md) |
| ASR | Local faster-whisper | 10-02 | [004](decisions/ADR-004-asr-backend.md) |
| Safety fast-path | Rule-based regex | 10-01 | [005](decisions/ADR-005-safety-fastpath.md) |
| Working agreement | Direct commits to `main`; pvjthomas keeps write access | 10-04 | [006](decisions/ADR-006-working-agreement.md) |

## How to update this

1. After each session add a dated entry (newest first). Put open items on GitHub, not here.
2. Add measurements to the testing table.
3. Log every decision as an ADR and add the one-liner above.
4. Record gotchas so they aren't rediscovered.
